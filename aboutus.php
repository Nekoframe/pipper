				<p class="animatable fadeInUp slower delay-1s">From a wife’s care and concern for her husband’s allergies came a line of natural, non-toxic household cleaning products that has become a favorite in many homes throughout Asia. </p>

				<content class="animatable fadeInUp slower">
					The concept for Pipper Standard began in 2010 when our founder, Peter Wainman, had a severe allergic reaction to chemicals used in cleaning products found in Asia.  After the life-threatening allergic reaction, Peter and his wife decided to replace the chemical cleaning products in their home with natural products. After looking at what was available in the market, they could not find any products that met their standard of being truly natural, free of known allergens, and which could still clean comparable to chemical cleaning products.  As a result, they decided to make their own.
				</content>


				<content class="animatable fadeInUp slower">After extensive research and development, a team of scientists led by our co-founders successfully developed a unique fruit fermentation process based around pineapple that yields a cleaning fluid full of natural organic acids, natural enzymes, and biosurfactants, which act synergistically to clean, and is naturally preservative. Pipper 
Standard was then commercialized to help out those who, like Peter, suffered from allergies and to provide the market with a safe, non-toxic alternative range of cleaning products. </content>

decrease rates of allergies and asthma as well as decrease contamination of our environment.

							<content>Our vision as a company is to improve people’s lives by promoting the replacement of

							<p>Fermentation makes us natural</p>

							<content>Fermentation is a process that has been used for food preparation for thousands of years. We were able to harness the fermentation concept and invent pineapple fermentation technology through lacto-fermentation that produces an extremely powerful cleaning agent. </content>

							<content>Lacto-fermentation is fermentation using lactobacillus or lactic acid bacteria (LAB) (commonly known as probiotic bacteria). Lacto-fermentation can produce natural cleaning materials 
including numerous kinds of acid such as lactic acid, acetic acid, formic and propionic acids and other natural enzymes with natural anti-microbial properties. This technology is what makes Pipper Standard clean as well as chemical cleaners and allows us the ability to avoid using harmful chemicals. Pipper Standard is the first brand in the world that uses fermented fruit fluid as the main active ingredient to naturally and safely clean. </content>
